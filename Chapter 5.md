State information typically includes various details and parameters associated with the communication session or connection setup. Some examples of state information might include:  
- Connection Status: Indicates whether the connection is open, closed, or in a particular state (e.g., established, terminated, or waiting).  
- Session Identifiers: Unique identifiers or session keys assigned to identify and manage a particular communication session or connection.  
- Protocol-Specific Parameters: Parameters specific to the communication protocol being used, such as sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, flags, timeouts, window sizes, etc.  
- Error Handling Information: Information related to error detection, recovery mechanisms, or error control (e.g., checksums, error codes, retransmission counts).  
- Resource Allocation: Details about allocated resources, such as buffer space, bandwidth, or any resources reserved for the communication session.
